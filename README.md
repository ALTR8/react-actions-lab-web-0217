# React Actions Lab

## Objectives

1. Practice reacting to user input in actions
2. Explain how actions help modularize applications
3. Pass components as context for actions

## Overview

MOstly we're looking to test that students have moved their event handlers out
of their components and into separate actions (or action creators, even). This
should hypothetically simplify tests for this lab, since we can just test the
actions directly.
